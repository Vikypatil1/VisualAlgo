## _LightAlgorithm_
Basicallly we have named the project after the actual function and combined it with our UI theme we going for i.e a bit neonish.
The basic job of the webapp is the simplify the working of various DS algorithms with the help of the visuals where we will try to give the code at below of the output and user can map the visuals with the code.
About the home page - We kept it simple and just gave a toolbar with 4 options and a main button which will direct to search and sort pages. Also tried some new with the ALGORITHM label there.
Sort - We have given 4 choices to user to choose between i.e bubble, selection, quick and merge. In the toolbar at left side provided size and speed drag bar where he can choose. At the right side GENERATE NEW ARRAY for randomizing the array elements in sort of bars, RESET for reseting the page, or stoping the visuals, and Home for redirecting to the home page.
This was just overall working and explaination, Now we will try to deep it.

## The Sort Functions -
In the sort's html file you can see div named "barsCon" where the main visuals resides. In the css for the bars we have given the shapes and colors or other properties. The main thing is in the .js file.
At default we have given the number of bars as 10 and for the height of the bars we have created a randomnumbergen func and mapped it with the hight between 100 to 500px.
